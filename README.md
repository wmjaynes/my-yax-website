# Project: MyYax } My Yax Website

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "my-yax-website", generated from the "yaxt-tinysites-stylecss" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "my-yax-website-deploy".

# Tiny Site: style.css

This is a one page "tiny site" built using the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

The page is styled with the [style.css](https://css-pkg.github.io/style.css/) stylesheet by [Nate Goldman](https://ungoldman.com/) and [Bret Comnes](https://twitter.com/bcomnes).

## Using the on-page editor

You can edit the page using the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) on-page editor. Use the link `https://example.com/index.html?login` to open the edit toolbar. Click "Edit" in the toolbar to begin editing.
